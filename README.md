# Obstacle-avoiding-robot
This is a trmperatue sensed obstacle avoiding robot. This robot can sense temperature and measure distance from any object simultaneously. I have used PID controller in this robot to navigate by avoiding obstacles. 
To run this project download arduino code.zip file. Open any one of the codes on your arduino IDE. Make the circuits according to pins declared on the code and burn the code on your arduino.
